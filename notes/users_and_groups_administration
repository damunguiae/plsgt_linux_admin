Admin best practices

* Never log in using a root account. If you need to do this to manage all of the other accounts, you can setup an administration account by
  adding a user to the sudo  user group.

* Create accounts for each user

* Assing only the necessary permissions to each users


Account Data

all users encrypted password are stored in the /etc/shadow file

Another file that contains account's data is /etc/passwd
It no longer contains password information, at least not in newest kernel's versions.
an /etc/passwd is composed like this:

<user name>:<x <-this inicates an existence of a password in the shadow file >:<user id>:<group id>
:<location of the user's home directory, can be ,,, if empty>:<location of the user's default shell>

/etc/group file is mostly the same, contains information about the groups present in the system and which users belongs to each group

the sintax is like <group name>:<x <- means that users in the group have a password set>:<the list of users tha belongs to this group,
 separated by commas>

Account's activity data

*you can get all this information easily by user by executing the command id <user's name>

*you can see which users have sessions in a system using the command "who"

*you can use the "w" command to show the same as "who" but also add what are they doing

*you can use the "last" command to show all the logins for the system


Access Control - Managing users and groups

*Create new users with "useradd" commnad - > sudo useradd -m <user name> ; -m creates the user's directory in the home directory
*You can assing a new password to a user using the passwd command, like this: sudo passwd <user's name>
	next time <user's name> logs in, the password can be changed with the same passwd command but without being in the sudo group (don't use sudo)


*new user's home file gets their home directory builded with the files that are presents in the /etc/skel directory
*you can change or add files here and the new users home page automatically will have them
*you can use the "group add" command to create a new group
*you can the "chown" command to change the group's ownershit of directory and files like this sudo chown :<groups name>:<user name, can be empty> <file or directory path>
*you can use "usermod" command to add a user to a group, like this sudo usermod -a<add> -G<Group> <group's name> <user's name>
